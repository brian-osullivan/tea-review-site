Part of a series on [Water](https://web.archive.org/web/20150910090215/http://walkerteareview.com/tag/water/).

The importance of water to good tea continues to reveal itself. It has been a major consideration even before Lu Yu’s [Cha Jing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Classic_of_Tea#Five:_Boiling_.28.E4.BA.94.E4.B9.8B.E7.85.AE.29), will continue to be for centuries to come.

Most of the issues regarding good water relate not as much to the H2O itself as the elements that come in the water. It is doubtful that a universally “perfect” water for all teas will ever be found or developed. There is a spectrum of better and worse waters, and that spectrum may vary according to the teas being steeped and the conditions in which it is steeped.

Nevertheless, there are some considerations that may put us on track towards better water.
