Making your own tea at the office or at school can be a very healthy, affordable and rewarding experience, if preparation and clean-up are simple and convenient. Take a look at how easy the steeping cup can be, and try for yourself.

I used Dragon Pearlâ€˜s steeping cup which is FREE with an order of 2 items or more. You may also want to try [Adagio Teas](https://www.adagio.com/index.html) [tasting set](https://www.adagio.com/portions/portions_sampler.html) ($9) for ease of use and cleaning. This is what the pros use to evaluate teas.

What other methods do you use? Add a comment or shoot me an email (jasonowalker@gmail.com) about the most convenient, effective way to prep your loose teas at work or school.
